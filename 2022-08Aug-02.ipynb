If the same data in Python is 10x bigger than the data in C, then you can handle more data in C, even if it's a harder language to work with.\n",

    "The reason is something called \"NumPy.\" This is a Python module, written mostly in C.  It allows us to work with data in C format (i.e., very fast, very small), using a very thin layer of Python on top of it.  NumPy is super fast and super efficient, but it lets us work with friendly Python code.\n",
